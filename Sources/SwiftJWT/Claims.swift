/**
  A protocol for representing the claims on a JSON web token.
  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1
 ### Usage Example: ###
 ```swift
 struct AdminClaims: Claims {
     var sub: String
     var isAdmin: Bool
     var exp: Date?
 }
  let jwt = JWT(claims: AdminClaims(sub: "Kitura", isAdmin: true, exp: Date(timeIntervalSinceNow: 3600)))
 ```
 */

	 The "exp" (expiration time) claim identifies the expiration time on
	 or after which the JWT MUST NOT be accepted for processing.  The
	 processing of the "exp" claim requires that the current date/time
	 MUST be before the expiration date/time listed in the "exp" claim.
	 Implementers MAY provide for some small leeway, usually no more than
	 a few minutes, to account for clock skew.
	 */

	 The "nbf" (not before) claim identifies the time before which the JWT
	 MUST NOT be accepted for processing.  The processing of the "nbf"
	 claim requires that the current date/time MUST be after or equal to
	 the not-before date/time listed in the "nbf" claim.  Implementers MAY
	 provide for some small leeway, usually no more than a few minutes, to
	 account for clock skew.
	 */

	 issued.  This claim can be used to determine the age of the JWT.
